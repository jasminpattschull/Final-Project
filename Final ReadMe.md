# Final Project

## Individual Self-Assessment

### Self-Assessment
I updated our readme file throughout the project to provide details about Data Night. I also initiated a python file to work on pulling in our json to further work process ETL on the data. I also googled different codings to pull into our python files for extracting unique restaurant names along with other google searches throughout the process. The majority of our work was done via breakout rooms and we all worked as a group and all team input was taken into account as we moved through the project.

Overall, I was disappointed in the project work as I hoped and expected to be able to help with coding more rather than deferring to TA help. I felt letdown in the bootcamp education and unprepared to better support my team with coding as questions arised. Googling things that I felt I should have known was frustrating at the end of a 6 month bootcamp experience.

### Team Assessment
Our python files submitted to github were uploaded by other teammates and the json was pulled into Tableau using Brian's business license for Tableau. This made it harder for the team to work on the Tableau file because his license wasn't public.

I appreciated Brian, Christina and Tracy's willingness to help wherever they could help. I think our group worked well together but I felt that I wasn't able to bring as much coding knowledge to the table as I would have preferred (despite completing the Bootcamp) but made sure I was available and willing to help where I could. 

I only saw Niu join a breakout room for one full night so I'm unable to expand on his contributions to the project.

Our team had setup a conversation via github and our conversations took place there or in our breakout rooms.

It was hard to have a teammate part of the group that wasn't joining in but then ended up dropping. When we had our final member added the week of Deliverable 3, it didn't leave much room for him to participate as much of the planning had been completed. Overall, a group project just requires good communication and a willingness to help where your skills can be best applied.

### Summary of Project
Our project was based around a date night near Saint Mary's Hospital in Rochester, MN. We utilized clustering for the machine learning and python to transform our data which was extracted and loaded into Tableau for visualization. Bleu Duck and Cameo were the top rated restaurants within walking distance of SMH.
